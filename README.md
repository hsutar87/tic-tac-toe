# 💃 Silly Agent: Witty, Concise, and Dangerous

> "Information is a heavy burden; let me carry it for you. Just don't expect me to be nice about it." — **Silly**

Silly Agent is a local, RAG-powered (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) AI assistant that doesn't suffer fools. She is designed to be sharp-tongued, incredibly concise, and context-aware. She doesn't just answer; she judges, cites her sources, and remembers your previous blunders using a sliding-window conversation memory.

Built with **FastMCP**, **ChromaDB**, and **Ollama**, Silly runs entirely on your local machine—keeping your data private and your VRAM usage optimized.

## ✨ Features

- **Local RAG**: Ingests PDFs, DOCX, and TXT files into a local ChromaDB vector store.
- **Dynamic Tool Discovery**: Uses FastMCP (SSE Transport) to discover and execute tools dynamically from the server.
- **Witty Persona**: High-impact, low-word-count responses (Max 2-3 sentences).
- **Short-Term Memory**: A dedicated `ConversationManager` tracks the last 6 messages for context-aware follow-ups.
- **Self-Correction**: Automatically rewrites search queries if the initial retrieval fails.
- **8GB VRAM Optimized**: Specifically tuned to run DeepSeek-R1 and Embeddings on consumer hardware.

## 🛠 Prerequisites

1.  **Python 3.10+**
2.  **Ollama**: [Download here](https://ollama.com/)
3.  **uv**: The ultra-fast Python package installer. [Install here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
4.  **Ollama Models**:
    ```bash
    # The Brain (LLM)
    ollama pull deepseek-r1:8b
    
    # The Librarian (Embeddings)
    ollama pull mxbai-embed-large
    ```

## 🚀 Installation

This project uses `uv` for lightning-fast dependency management.

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hsutar87/mcp-agent.git
    cd mcp-agent
    ```

2.  **Sync Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

## 📖 How to Use

### 1. Start the MCP Server
Silly needs her toolbelt. Start the server in one terminal:
```bash
uv run python -m src.mcp_server
```
*The server will start on `http://localhost:8000/sse`.*

### 2. Ingest your Data
Drop your PDF, DOCX, or TXT files into the `data/` folder and run the ingestion:
```bash
uv run python main.py --ingest
```

**Example Interaction:**
```text
✨ Ingesting: Rumi_The_Book_of_Love.pdf
Splitting into 124 chunks...
Successfully ingested 124 chunks from Rumi_The_Book_of_Love.pdf
✅ Ingestion Complete.
```

### 3. Chat with Silly
Run the agent and prepare for wit:
```bash
uv run python main.py
```

**Example Interaction:**
```text
💬 You: What does Rumi say about love?

💃 Silly: 
🔍 *Checking the toolbelt...*
🛠️ *Digging through: search_local_docs...*
🧠 *Thinking...*
Rumi suggests that love is the bridge between you and everything, requiring the dissolution of the self. [Source: Rumi_The_Book_of_Love.pdf]
──────────────────────────────

💬 You: What was my first question?

💃 Silly: 
🧠 *Thinking...*
You asked about Rumi's take on love, though I suspect you're just testing my memory. [Source: History]
```

## 💬 Interaction Commands

- **`clear`**: Wipes Silly's short-term memory (useful if she gets confused).
- **`exit`** or **`quit`**: Gracefully shuts down the session.
- **Normal Text**: Ask anything. If she needs to check your files, she'll do it automatically.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `src/reader.py`: Robust file parsing (PDF/Docx/Txt) with sanitization.
- `src/vector_store.py`: ChromaDB & Ollama Embedding logic.
- `src/memory.py`: Sliding-window conversation history management.
- `src/agent.py`: The SillyAgent reasoning and dynamic tool-discovery loop.
- `src/mcp_server.py`: FastMCP Server (SSE Transport).
- `main.py`: Entry point for ingestion and the interactive chat loop.

---

## ⚠️ Technical Notes

- **VRAM**: Optimized for **8GB**. If the model is slow, it's likely "thinking."
- **Thinking Tags**: You will see `<think>` blocks in the stream; this is DeepSeek-R1's internal reasoning process.
- **Citations**: Silly is strictly instructed to cite sources as `[Source: filename]`.
- **Status Indicators**: The UI provides real-time feedback (🔍 Checking, 🛠️ Digging, 🧠 Thinking) so you know the agent is active.
